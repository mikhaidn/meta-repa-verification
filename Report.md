# Benchmarking Repa and Meta-Repa

## Introduction

This report presents the results of benchmarking basic array operations implemented using the `repa` library and a custom EDSL, `meta-repa`. The goal is to compare their performance and understand the benefits of using EDSLs (Embedded domain specific languagescd cd) in Haskell.

## Methodology

1. **Repa**: Implement basic array operations and benchmark them.
2. **Meta-Repa**: Implement equivalent operations using the `meta-repa` EDSL and benchmark them.

## Results

| Operation               | Library  | Time (ms) |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Matrix Multiplication   | Repa     | X.XX      |
| Sum of Expressions      | Meta-Repa| X.XX      |
| Product of Expressions  | Meta-Repa| X.XX      |

## Conclusion

The benchmarks indicate that `meta-repa` performs comparably to `repa` for basic operations, demonstrating the viability of EDSLs for high-performance Haskell programming.

# Further Research

## Algorithmic Analysis

- **FFT Performance**: Compare the performance of FFT implemented using `repa` and `meta-repa`.
- **Use Cases**: Identify new use cases for `meta-repa` and explore optimizations.

## Conclusion

The results confirm that EDSLs can provide strong performance guarantees and are suitable for high-performance applications in Haskell.
